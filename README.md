# Problems


During the design thinking phase of a project, we have to choose a
problem we will be working with. The problem is, in principle, any
problem at all, anything that would be interesting you to solve if you
had the time or resources. Eventually we will have to settle in just a
few of them, but in this phase any problem is OK.

In design thinking, problems have to be as real-life as possible, that
is why they are usually described via newspaper or blog articles. The
article does not have even to identify what's the actual problem, just
describe situations that could be potentially solved.

Let's link below some articles or websites that describe situations,
and by the end of the first day we will use them for the design
thinking session. You can link as many as you want.
